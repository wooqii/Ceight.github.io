        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

        Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8] and all major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it.
        
        As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.
        
        Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make <span class="js">JavaScript</span> available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
        
        Although there are strong outward similarities between <span class="js">JavaScript</span> and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; <span class="js">JavaScript</span> was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[9]
